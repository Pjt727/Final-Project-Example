# Final-Project-Example

## Requirements
- at least 1 `for` or `while` loop
- at least 3 variables (one variable must be `list`)
- all inputs sanitized
- at least 1 function
- proper variable names
- at least one global variable (must be used in a function)

## Game-idea
- Try to guess a random number between 1 and 10
    - generate random number
    - ask for input
    - check input
        - if valid
        - if is generated number
            - `True`: back to ask for input
            - `False`: user wins

## Coding
- Create the game in as few lines as possible
- 1 line example super cheating
- 3 line example using ;'s
- 8 line example not using ;'s
- n line example using what I think to be best practices (has slightly more functionality as well)
- I'm sure you might be able to do >3 line without cheating to the extent that I did
- You can probably also do >8 while still not using ;'s
